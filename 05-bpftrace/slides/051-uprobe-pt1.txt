% hands on: reading userspace returns

Nomad is a Go program that orchestrates other applications. One of its
functions is to collect metrics stats from those applications. Suppose
we get a user report that we're dropping memory stats under load. We
have a hypothesis that collection is taking too long, so we want to
trace the timing.

Let's get the path to the function to hook. We look in the source and
find ~collectMemoryStats~. Let's check that path:

  ~$ objdump -t $(which nomad)  | grep collectMemoryStats
