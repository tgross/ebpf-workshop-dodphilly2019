% hands on: tracing read bytes using a tracepoint

Looks the same as ~kretprobe~:

~sudo bpftrace -e \
~    'tracepoint:syscalls:sys_exit_read  \
~    { @bytes = lhist(args->ret, 0, 2000, 200); }'


Why?

* ~kretprobe~ can trace *any* kernel function but isn't "stable" b/c
  it can trace kernel internals that might change between versions.
* ~tracepoints~ are considered part of the "user facing" API and the
  kernel devs say ~"WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE!"~ (Swearing optional.)

Use tracepoints whenever you can over kprobe/kretprobe.
