% hands on: tracing read bytes using a kretprobe

In Linux, all files are accessed through the Virtual Filesystem Switch,
or VFS, a layer of code which implements generic filesystem actions and
vectors requests to the correct specific code to handle the request.

* Instrument ~vfs_read~ function in the kernel using a ~kretprobe~.

* Create an array called ~bytes~ that will dump a linear histogram
  where the arguments are: ~value~, ~min~, ~max~, ~step~. The first argument
  (~retval~) of ~vfs_read()~ is the return value: the number of bytes read;
