% BPF is Event-Driven

Examples:

* Network device w/ BPF program attached (~tc~ or ~xdp~) fires an event that
  triggers execution on each packet received.

* Kernel address w/ kprobe and BPF program attached (ex. ~bpftrace~) will
  trap when the code at that address is executed, which fires an event to
  invoke the kprobe's callback function and triggers execution of the BPF
  program.

* Runtime w/ ~udst~ and BPF program attached (ex. ~pythonflows-bfpcc~) fires
  the callback each time the tracepoint is hit.
