% The BPF in-kernel Virtual Machine


* Implements a general purpose low level RISC instruction set.

* Runs the instructions in response to events triggered by the kernel

* Implements a verifier, so that your programs can't break the kernel!

* Has an upstream LLVM backend, you can compile eBPF code with ~clang~.
  Write BPF programs in C, which get compiled to bytecode for the VM.
