% Maps

* BPF Maps data stores that live in the kernel

* Can be accessed by any BPF program that knows about them

* Programs that run in user-space can also access these maps by using
  file descriptors

* You can store any kind of data in a map, as long as you specify the
  data size correctly before hand

* The kernel treats keys and values as binary blobs and it doesnâ€™t
  care about what you keep in a map

* This is what we use to let userspace programs to extract or feed
  information into BPF programs running in the kernel!
