% Use cases for tc


* Policy enforcement for containers: network traffic for containers
  passes through veth pair in the network namespace, so a tc BPF program
  can hook all ingress/egress traffic to it.

* Forwarding and load-balancing: NAT traffic and direct east-west
  traffic flows leaving a container (i.e. a service mess).

* Flow sampling / monitoring: high performance monitoring at the lowest
  level of the networking stack where we have bidirectional flows (and
  without getting involved in hardware off-loading).
