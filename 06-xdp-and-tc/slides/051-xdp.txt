% eXpress Data Path (XDP)


Runs BPF program at earliest possible point - as soon as the network
driver receives the packet, before ~skbuff~ has been allocated.

Because of this, operation modes are closely tied to network driver
and hardware availability:

  * ~Native~: driver supports XDP, code runs on driver receive path.
              (Most of the time w/ good drivers and on the cloud.)

  * ~Offloaded~: hardware supports XDP, so code is executed on NIC CPU.

  * ~Generic~: mode for when driver/hardware support isn't there.

Ingress only!
