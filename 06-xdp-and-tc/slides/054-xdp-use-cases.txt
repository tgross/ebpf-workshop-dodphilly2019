% XDP use cases


* DDoS mitigation, firewalling: use ~XDP_DROP~ to efficiently drop
  packets with minimal overhead.

* Forwarding and load balancing: mangle incoming packets to increase
  headroom for encapsulation; hairpin (~XDP_TX~) or redirect to a
  different NIC (~XDP_REDIRECT~).

* Pre-stack filtering / processing: "harden" the networking stack by
  using ~XDP_DROP~ to drop anything we don't expect to see (ex. this
  box doesn't serve DNS so why accept UDP?)
