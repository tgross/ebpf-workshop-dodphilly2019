% Traffic Control (tc)


* Traffic Control is the kernel packet scheduling subsystem, consisting
  of queueing disciplines around packet flows.

* ~tc~ is a command line tool for manipulating traffic control
  configuration (ref ~man tc 8~).

* We can load BPF programs as "classifiers" (~cls_bpf~) to filter and
  take action on packets at both ingress/egress (ref ~man tc-bpf 8~).

* BPF program receives the ~sk_buff~ struct with metadata we saw before.
