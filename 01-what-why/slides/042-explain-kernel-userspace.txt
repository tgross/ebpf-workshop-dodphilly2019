* ~kernel space~: The part of memory owned by the operating system
  kernel. Entering kernel space requires privileges; this stops
  applications from writing into each other's memory.

* ~user space~/~userland~: The part of memory owned by your applications.

* ~syscall~: The way a user program calls into the kernel. This
  ~interrupts~ the CPU to place it into privileged kernel mode, which
  requires switching out the userland stack for the kernel stack.

* ~context switch~: When the kernel scheduler decides your application
  thread should give up some time on the CPU to other applications, or
  other threads. This also switches out the kernel stacks and has to
  restore a bunch of userland stuff as well.
