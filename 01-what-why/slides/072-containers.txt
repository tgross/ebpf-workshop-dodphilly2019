% eBPF with Containers


* Like all debugging tools, requires a high level of privilege.
  Not just ~root~ but ~ptrace~ and ~CAP_SYSADMIN~.

* Sidecar container with eBPF and other debugging tools can enter the
  target container's ~pid~ namespace.

* Some cool ~k8s~ stuff landed in ~bpftrace~ recently too.
