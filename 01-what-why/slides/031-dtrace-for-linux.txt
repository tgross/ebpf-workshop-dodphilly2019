% eBPF: "DTrace for Linux"


* User-defined, sandboxed, bytecode executed in the kernel.

* Dynamically instrument kernel functions (~kprobes~), userland native
  functions (~uprobes~), hardware events, and CPU profiles.

* Statically instrument arbitrary applications w/ User
  Statically-Defined Tracepoints (~usdt~). Runtimes like Python, Ruby,
  and Java can be compiled to include ~usdt~ to instrument their own
  functions.
