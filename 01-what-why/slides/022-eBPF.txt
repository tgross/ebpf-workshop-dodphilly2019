%  The extended BPF implementation (eBPF)


* Introduced in 2014 by Alexei Starovoitov

* Increased register size from 2 32-bit registers to 10 64-bit
  registers. Supports maps and has a stack.

* Initially designed to optimize network filters

* Today only eBPF is used in the kernel; cBPF bytecode is translated
  transparently into eBPF.
