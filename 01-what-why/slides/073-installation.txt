% Installing BPF Tools


* ~bcc-tools~ and ~bftrace~ require kernel headers specific to the
  kernel version. Shipping as a container means you have to mount
  kernel headers from target host.

* Most Linux distros have a kernel headers metapackage you can keep up
  to date with the host's kernel.

* My recommendation: ship tools on the host and make it part of the
  CI/CD pipeline with Packer for your AMI or other machine
  image. YMMV.

* Installing software is ~boring~ so all tools in this workshop are
  already installed.
