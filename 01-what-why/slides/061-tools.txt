% BCC and bpftrace


~IO Visor~ project under the Linux Foundation

~BCC~ (BPF Compiler Collection) is a toolkit for creating eBPF
programs + a collection of many useful pre-written tools

~bpftrace~ is a newer approach with a more DTrace-like usage,
which can be built as a static binary. A bit unstable still.
