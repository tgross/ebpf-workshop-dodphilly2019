Need to set up a ~ctypes~ data structure to parse the event data. This
has to match the struct we created in C.

~import ctypes as ct

~TASK_COMM_LEN = 16    # linux/sched.h
~
~class Data(ct.Structure):
~    _fields_ = [
~        ("comm", ct.c_char * TASK_COMM_LEN)
~    ]
~
~def dump_data(cpu, data, size):
~    event = ct.cast(data, ct.POINTER(Data)).contents
~    printb(b"%-16s" % event.comm)
